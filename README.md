# REVaRS - Enterprise Risk & Reliability Management System

**REVaRS (Risk Exposure Visualisation and Reporting Software)** is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade web platform designed to manage industrial risk, reliability, and operational efficiency. It aggregates data from various systems to provide a unified view of asset health, safety barriers, and operational risks.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 Dynamic Dashboards
*   **Real-time Visualization:** Interactive dashboards (V2/V3) providing high-level overviews and deep dives into asset performance.
*   **Asset Health Monitoring:** Track the status of critical assets and functional locations (FLOCs).
*   **Customizable Widgets:** Users can configure their views to focus on the metrics that matter most.

### 🛡️ Advanced Risk Management
*   **Bowtie Analysis:** Visual risk assessment tools to map threats, consequences, and barriers.
*   **Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM):** Standardized risk evaluation using configurable matrices.
*   **Barrier Management:** Track the health and effectiveness of safety barriers in real-time.
*   **Risk Mapped Images:** Visual overlay of risks on plant/asset diagrams.

### 📈 Scenario Simulation & Modeling
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Simulate various operational scenarios to predict potential failures or risks.
*   **Deterioration Analysis:** Model asset deterioration over time to plan maintenance effectively.

### 📝 Activity & Backlog Tracking
*   **Action Tracker:** Centralized management of corrective actions and tasks.
*   **Backlog Management:** Track maintenance backlog and prioritize work orders.
*   **User Questionnaires:** Collect field data and operator feedback directly through the system.

### 🏭 Asset & Operations Management

*   **Parts & Inventory:** Integration with parts management for maintenance planning.
*   **SECA (System Criticality Assessment):** Tools for evaluating system criticality.

### 📑 Reporting & Notifications
*   **Automated Reporting:** Generate PDF and Excel reports for stakeholders.
*   **Smart Notifications:** Real-time alerts for critical events, overdue actions, or risk threshold breaches.
*   **Export Capabilities:** Export Bowtie diagrams and risk data for external use.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** ASP.NET Core, C#
*   **Database:** SQL Server, Entity Framework Core
*   **Frontend:** Razor Views, jQuery, Bootstrap, AdminLTE
*   **Visualization:** Highcharts, Morris.js, DevExpress
